And that many of these include free certificates and badges? To help you choose one that's right for you, I've created a full list. As avid online learners, my Class Central colleagues and I have completed hundreds of online courses over the years, including many with free certificates, as you can see in the collage below. In 2024, free certificates have become rarer. But if you know where to look, there is still an abundance of free certificates available online for learning software development.  Some of the free certificates earned by the Class Central team. As you likely know, freeCodeCamp offers free certifications. But so do big tech companies and institutions such as Google, Microsoft, and Harvard. In this article, we bring together all the free certificates and badges that are scattered across the web. In total, the platforms below offer over 900 free certificate courses for learning software development. I (Dhawal) started Class Central back in 2011, when universities such as Stanford began to offer some of their courses online for free. Since then, the Class Central database has grown to over 250K online courses. Having written about online education for over a decade, I remember when platforms like Coursera and edX offered free certificates. Then, rather abruptly, free certificates seemed to pretty much disappear. This inspired us to write a Massive List of Free Certificates and Badges. To our surprise, we discovered there were still thousands of free certificates available online. To date, that article has received 10M views. In the same vein, this article aims to draw attention to the organizations that continue to support open education in software development by offering free certificate courses. These include:  Learning platforms — e.g. LinkedIn Learning, freeCodeCamp, and FutureLearn  Leading universities — e.g. Harvard and the University of Helsinki  Big tech companies — e.g. Google, Microsoft, and IBM.   Please note, Class Central is not involved in running the courses or issuing certificates. This is a dynamic field and you may discover that a course you choose is no longer available, or doesn’t have a free certificate any more. We recommend you always check before starting a course. freeCodeCamp Free Certifications  Archisha's freeCodeCamp free certificate freeCodeCamp platform offers thousands of hours of learning content, broken down into certifications on subjects such as web development and data science.
